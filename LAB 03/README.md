# program 1
📌 Program Description

This C++ program takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd using the conditional (ternary) operator. It then displays the result on the screen, demonstrating basic input handling, arithmetic operations, and decision-making in C++.

# program 2
📌 Program Description

This C++ program takes three integer inputs representing ages from the user and categorizes each age as Child, Teenager, or Adult using the conditional (ternary) operator. It demonstrates basic input handling, use of nested ternary operators for decision-making, and output display in C++.

# program 3
📌 Program Description
