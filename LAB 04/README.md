# program 1
📌 Program Description

User to enter an integer and checks whether the number is positive. If the number is greater than zero, it displays a message indicating that the number is positive. 

# program 2
📌 Program Description

This C++ program prompts the user to enter an integer and checks whether the number is even. It uses the modulo operator (%) and an if statement to determine if the number is divisible by 2. If the condition is true, it displays a message indicating that the number is even.

# program 3
📌 Program Description

This C++ program takes three integer inputs from the user and determines the largest among them using simple if statements. It compares the numbers sequentially to find and display the greatest value. This program demonstrates basic input handling, variable comparison, and decision-making in C++.

# program 4
📌 Program Description

This C++ program takes a student's marks (out of 100) as input and assigns a grade based on the marks using a series of if statements. The grading scale includes A+, A, B, C, and Fail categories. 


# program 5
📌 Program Description

This C++ program prompts the user to enter a traffic signal color represented by the characters R, G, or Y (case-insensitive). Based on the input, it displays the corresponding action: Stop for red, Go for green, and Slow down for yellow. This program demonstrates basic input handling, character comparison, and conditional statements in C++.

# program 6
📌 Program Description

This C++ program simulates a simple bank withdrawal process. It prompts the user to enter their current account balance and the desired withdrawal amount. The program then checks if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the available balance. If yes, it deducts the amount and displays the updated balance; otherwise, it shows an "Insufficient balance" message.

# program 7
📌 Program Description

This C++ program determines a user's eligibility for a loan based on their salary and work experience. The program prompts the user to input their salary and years of work experience. The eligibility criteria are:

Salary of $25,000 or more qualifies automatically.

Otherwise, if the user has more than 5 years of work experience and a salary of at least $20,000, they are also eligible.

If neither condition is met, the user is not eligible for the loan.

This program demonstrates nested if-else statements, input handling, and conditional logic in C++.

# program 8
📌 Program Description

This C++ program calculates the net salary of an employee based on their grade and years of service. The user inputs the employee's grade (A, B, or C) and their years of service. The program then:

Assigns a basic salary based on the grade.

Calculates a bonus percentage according to years of service.

Computes the gross salary as the sum of basic salary and bonus.

Applies tax deductions based on the gross salary.
