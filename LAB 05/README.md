# task 1
📌 Program Description

This C++ program prompts the user to enter an integer and checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. It uses if, else if, and else statements to compare the entered value with zero. Based on the condition, the program displays an appropriate message indicating the nature of the number.

# task 2
📌 Program Description

This C++ program prompts the user to enter the current temperature and provides appropriate advice based on the temperature value. It uses if-else if-else conditional statements to classify the temperature into different ranges. If the temperature is extremely high, it advises staying indoors. For warm temperatures, it suggests staying hydrated. For pleasant weather, it encourages outdoor activities, and for low temperatures, it recommends wearing warm clothes.

# task 3
📌 Program Description

This C++ program simulates a simple user login system.
It prompts the user to enter a username and a password, then checks the entered credentials using if-else conditions.

If the username is "admin" and the password is "12345", the program grants access.

If the username is correct but the password is incorrect, it displays a wrong password message.

If the username does not exist, it shows a user not found message.

This program demonstrates the use of string variables, input/output, and conditional statements in C++.

# task 4
📌 Program Description — Student Result and Scholarship Eligibility System

This C++ program takes marks of three subjects from the user and calculates the total marks and percentage. It assigns grades to each subject based on the marks using if-else statements. The program also checks whether the student has failed in any subject and determines eligibility for merit or regular scholarship based on grades and total marks.

# task 5
📌 Program Description

This C++ program checks whether a person is eligible for a loan based on their age and income. The program first asks the user to enter their age and monthly income. It uses nested if statements to verify the eligibility conditions. If the user is 18 years or older and has an income of at least $30,000, the program displays a message confirming loan eligibility. If the age condition is met but the income is insufficient, it informs the user accordingly. If the user is under 18, the program clearly states that they are not eligible for a loan due to age restrictions.

# task 6
📌 Program Description

This C++ program implements a basic authentication and role-based access system.
It prompts the user to enter a username and password and verifies them using conditional statements. If the credentials are correct, the program asks for the user’s role (Admin or Guest) and grants access accordingly.

Admin users receive full access

Guest users receive limited access

Any other role results in no access

If authentication fails, access is denied

The program uses nested if-else statements and logical operators to control the flow and make decisions.
